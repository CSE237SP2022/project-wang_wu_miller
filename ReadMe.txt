What user stories were completed this iteration?
We fixed all the requirements and test cases, and finished all 4 functions for our app. Our app could record the money you spend in different situation and calculate the total money you spent (with a note, date and category information), and can also calculate the percentage for different category. 

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
We will try to implement a login function for the users.



Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
Every function that shows on the app should work.




What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
