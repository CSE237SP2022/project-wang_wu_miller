What user stories were completed this iteration?
We reorganized the BookKeeping class by shortening long functions and creating helper functions. We also added more unit tests for this class. 
Editing records has been made more user friendly. 
When the user provides a record name that does not exist, they are informed so and 
can ask to see the list of all records if they do not remember which ones exist or entirely quit the editing process.
They may quit editing at any time.


Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
All functions in the program are expected to work.


What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
command line: bash compile.sh
